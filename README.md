# lldb-sys

[![](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/lldb-sys.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/lldb-sys)

Dual licensed under the MIT and Apache 2 licenses. The C bindings for LLDB are
licensed under the same license as LLVM.

## Installation

This crate works with Cargo and is on
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/lldb-sys).
Add it to your `Cargo.toml` like so:

```toml
[dependencies]
lldb-sys = "0.0.27"
```

### Linux

Install the `lldb` and `liblldb-dev` packages for your platform so that
you have both LLDB itself installed as well as the headers and
other support files required.

### macOS:

You will need to have 2 environment variables set to do the build:

* `LLVM_ROOT` - This points to the root of the LLVM source tree.
* `LLVM_BUILD_ROOT` - This points to the root of an LLVM build directory. This may be the same as the LLVM source tree, especially if you're working from a binary install.

For now, you will have to set an `@rpath` manually on your executables so
that they can find the `LLDB.framework` at runtime. This can be done with
`install_name_tool`:

```shell
install_name_tool -add_rpath /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks target/debug/examples/barebones
```

Alternatively, for testing and local work, you can set the
`DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH`:

```shell
export DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks
```

## Contribution

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution
intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you,
as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be dual licensed
as above, without any additional terms or conditions.

## Binding Re-generation

If something happens where the Rust bindings need to be re-generated,
they were generated from this set of files with `bindgen`. We have a
script to automate some of the processing that is needed:

```shell
bin/generate_bindings.sh
```

After running that, you will want to selectively merge the changes
with what was previously there as the output of this process is
hand-edited to add usage of `libc` as well as doc comments in critical
places.
